    <h1>About Me!</h1>

    <p>Hello World! As you can see this is a webpage about me. My name is Veena Madhu and I am 18 years of age. I am currently in my senior year of highschool.</p>
    <p> I currently attend <a href="https://www.diyafah.com/homeimage">Al Diyafah High School</a> and I plan to do my higher studies at <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/en/">TU Delft</a> in Netherlands. I am going to do my bachelor's in Computer Science and Engineering and that's part of the reason I am taking this course on CS50. However there is more to my interests other than programming.</p>
    <p id="hyperlinks">If you want to know more about my <span class="name">interests</span> <a href="Interests.html">click here.</a> (I am still going to talk about programming as that is my major interest)</p>
    <p>Since I'm still in highschool I obviously live with my family. I live with my sister, mom and dad and I love them to bits. They are the most supportive people in my life and I am thankful for them. </p>

    <p> Another thing you should know about me is that I'm an extrovert but I had some trouble making friends that were actually meaningful. In my final year of schooling I found a real set of friends and I think they're few of the best people I have met in my life</p>
