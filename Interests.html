    <h2>Programming</h2>
    <p>Programming is my favorite hobby which I hope to make a profession some day in the future. I discovered it at the age of 14 and now I am determined to go to a good school which can teach me all there is to know. However you can never stop learning more about programming.</p>
    <h2>Drawing</h2>
    <p>Drawing has been a hobby since I was much younger. This is because my grandfather is a very good painter which inspired me to learn the art as well. I'm not as good as my grandfather but I am decent at certain types of sketching and painting.</p>
    <h2>Dancing</h2>
    <p>At the age of 5 my mom had me enrolled in Bharatnatyam dance class which is a traditional Indian dance style. I didn;t enjoy attending them as a child mainly because of the strict teacher but as I grew up I learned different styles from both classes and on my own through group performances. I feel dancing is just one of those thing that makes me very happy and cheerful.</p>
    <h2>Makeup</h2>
    <p>This is one of those skills that I picked up a lot more recently and that too mainly from watching the YouTube and Instagram videos. The makeup done in those videos just looked so flawless and beautiful that I couldn't help but try it out myself. Now I do it occassionally for fun since I have got eyeshadow palettes as gifts from both my mom and my friends.</p>
    <h2>Playing Minecraft</h2>
    <p> To be very honest,I'm not really a gamer but this is the one game I enjoy playing. Maybe because it brings out my creative side. Either way its something that I enjoy doing for fun, whether its alone, with my sister or with my friends.</p>
    <h2>Watching Netflix shows and movies</h2>
    <p>I think as of now there are very few people who don't enjoy watching Netflix. Now that the entertainment industry has so many shows and movies to choose from, there's something for everyone. Some of my favorite shows are Brooklyn Nine-Nine, Money Heist, The Good Place and Lucifer</p>
